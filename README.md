# Refine-Playlist
Songs bring back memories! 
Here, I've created an OS project using Spotify's web APIs to help you relive that year!
To get started get signed in to spotify and get your unique Client ID and and Client Secrete key from the Spotify developers website and replace the hash in the source code. 
Make sure to set also use the same Redirect URIs  by copying and pasting this *http://localhost:8888/callback* in your Spotify developer dashboard.
Run your code and enter your desired period and, Voila! You're all set up and your playlist has been created. Login to your spotify playlist and JAM all night long!
